## ✨ What Makes This Special?

### Authentic Film-like Experience
We've reverse-engineered what makes Fujifilm grain so beloved by photographers. Unlike basic noise filters, our algorithm creates grain that actually behaves like real film!

### 🎯 Natural Grain Features

| Feature | What It Does | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------------|----------------|
| **Monochromatic Grain** | Creates black-and-white grain only - no weird color speckles | Looks like real film grain, not digital noise |
| **Multi-frequency Noise** | Combines fine and coarse grain layers | Matches the complex texture of actual film |
| **Adaptive Strength** | Grain appears more in mid-tones, less in shadows/highlights | Follows how grain naturally appears in film photography |
| **Film-like Curve** | Special response curve that mimics film characteristics | Feels organic, not artificial or computer-generated |
| **Coherent Noise** | Natural patterns instead of completely random noise | Creates that "organic" film look we all love |
| **Optimized Performance** | Fast processing even on large images | No waiting around for your edits |

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Upload** your photo (JPG, PNG, or WebP)
2. **Choose** your ISO simulation or let it auto-detect from EXIF data
3. **Adjust** grain strength and size to taste
4. **Download** your film-style masterpiece!

## 🛠️ How to Use

### For Photographers:
- **ISO Simulation**: Select your desired film speed or use "Auto" to match your photo's original ISO
- **Natural Controls**: Simple sliders for strength and size - no complicated settings!
- **Real-time Preview**: See both original and grained versions side-by-side

### For Photo Editors:
- **EXIF-Aware**: Automatically reads camera data for authentic simulations
- **Non-destructive**: Your original file stays untouched
- **High Quality**: Maintains image quality while adding character

## 🎨 Technical Highlights

- **Pure Vanilla JS** - No frameworks, fast and lightweight
- **Canvas-based Processing** - Real-time image manipulation
- **EXIF Integration** - Reads camera metadata for accurate simulations
- **Responsive Design** - Works perfectly on desktop and mobile
- **Bootstrap UI** - Clean, professional interface

## 🌟 Perfect For

- **Film Photography Lovers** who want that analog look on digital photos
- **Fujifilm Shooters** looking to enhance their digital workflow
- **Social Media Creators** wanting unique, textured photos
- **Anyone** who believes grain adds soul to photographs!

## 📸 Supported Formats

- **Input**: JPG, PNG, WebP (up to 10MB)
- **Output**: High-quality JPG with embedded grain
- **Cameras**: Any digital camera (EXIF data automatically used when available)

## 🎯 Why Our Grain Looks Better

> "Most grain filters just add noise. Ours adds character."

Traditional digital noise tends to look messy and artificial. Our Fujifilm-inspired algorithm creates grain that:
- **Feels organic** like real film
- **Enhances texture** without destroying details
- **Adapts to your image** naturally
- **Preserves colors** while adding mono texture

## 🔧 Technical Details

Built with modern web technologies:
- HTML5 Canvas for image processing
- Vanilla JavaScript for performance
- Bootstrap 5 for sleek UI
- EXIF.js for metadata reading
- Responsive design principles
